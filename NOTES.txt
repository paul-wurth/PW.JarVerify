.DSA and .RSA are PKCS#7 signature files

> the signature file contains digest entries for the archive's files that look similar to the 
> digest-value entries in the manifest. However, while the digest values in the manifest are 
> computed from the files themselves, the digest values in the signature file are computed from

- Implication that a JAR with additional unsigned files can still pass validation (probably ignore 
even if non-standard?)
